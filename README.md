# ❄️ Andrei's 2023 Advent of Code ❄️

[![Build Status](https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/2023-advent-of-code/actions/workflows/aoc-ci-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/2023-advent-of-code/actions/workflows/aoc-ci-build.yml)

## Learning Goals

- [ ] Finish the first 12 days for Rust practice
- [ ] Use tch in at least 5 problems
- [ ] Actually understand Rust-y implementations of cyclic data structures

## Running the Code

Assuming [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/cargo.html) has been set up, to run a problem, simply use
the following:

```
cargo run --release --bin <XX_problem>
```

The above should automatically build the code with its dependencies, and run the appropriate problem.
